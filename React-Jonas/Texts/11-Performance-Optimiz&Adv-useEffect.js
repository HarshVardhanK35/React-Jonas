// ! Performance Optimization and Advanced useEffect
//----------------------------------------------------
/**
 * ! 1. Performance Optimization and Wasted Renders
 * 
 * - there are three main areas to focus on...
 * #1 Prevent wasted renders
 *      - we can memoize components with "memo"
 *      - we can also memoize functions and objects with "useMemo" and with "useCallback" hooks
 *      - follow a technique to pass elements into other elements as children or by normal prop
 *      (in order to prevent from being re-rendered)
 * 
 * #2 Improve app speed / responsiveness
 *      - we can use "useMemo" and "useCallback" hooks
 *      - also a new "useTransition" hook
 * 
 * #3 Reduce bundle size
 *      - by using fewer 3rd party packages
 *      - by implementing code-splitting and lazy loading 
 * 
 * $ NOTE:
 * - no need to use all these tools but only when a situation demands
 * (we can learn in this section when to use which tool)
 * 
 * >>> to know what are wasted renders (we need to know when a comp re-renders..) 
 * ? when does a component instance re-render ?
 * 
 * - in react, comp instance re-renders in 3 situations:
 * #1 when component state changes
 * #2 when ever component subscribed context changes
 * #3 whenever a parent component re-renders
 * 
 * $ NOTE:
 * (popular misconception: component re-renders when prop changes || but not)
 * 
 * - rendering a component does not mean that "DOM gets updated".. it is only that component function gets called (and react creates a new virtual DOM)
 * (this can be an expensive and waste operation)
 *      - this brings us to a topic of "WASTED RENDERS"
 * 
 * * Wasted Renders:
 * - a render that do not produce any change in DOM
 * (but all diffing and reconciliation has to be done, which is: expensive)
 * 
 * - this can be a problem only when there are frequent re-renders and when the component is very slow!
 * (... we gonna deal about this in next few topics)
 * 
 * ! 2. The Profiler Developer Tool
 * 
 * * Profiler:
 * - with this tool we can analyze renders and re-renders
 * (we can watch which component has rendered and why and also how long each rendering took)
 * 
 * - inspect -> inside react-dev tools there will be a "PROFILER" tool (along with components-tool) 
 * 
 * - UPDATE SETTING -> under "Profiler- tab":
 *      - activate: "record why each component rendered while profiling" 
 * 
 * >>> flame-graph
 * - where we can watch which comp has rendered with a graph - denoting which components are rendered and which are not!
 * 
 * - every render and re-render is coloured with different colors 
 * >>> GRAY color: 
 * - which states that particular component has not rendered OR re-rendered  
 * 
 * >>> YELLOW color:
 * - more yellow! which denotes that more time has been taken by that component to re-render 
 * 
 * >>> Hovering:
 * - hovering on each re-renders tell why the re-render has been happened!
 * 
 * $ IMPORTANT:
 * - use this tool which will be helpful, when building large applications and components
 * 
 * ! 3. A Surprising Optimization Trick With children
 * (learning: simple optimization technique)
 * 
 * * IMPORTANT:
 * -----
 * - this leverages children prop, in order to prevent some components from re-rendering
 * (this isn't the most used technique)
 * 
 * - but, this provides insights how react works internally!
 * 
 * >>> OPtimization 
 * - whenever a component is passed into another via children prop
 *      - so all those children components are already created before they were passed into another component 
 * 
 * - then react ignores those children as if they don't need any state
 *      - unless and until children consume context  
 * 
 * ! 4. Understanding memo
 * (over next few lectures.. we learn three more react-tools)
 * >>> memo function, useMemo and useCallback hooks!
 * 
 * ? Fundamental Concept ?
 * * Memoization:
 * ---
 * - optimization technique, that executes a pure function once, and saves results in memory.
 *      - if we try to execute function again with same arguments as before, previously saved results will be returned, "without executing the function once again!"
 * (the fn only will be executed when the arguments are different.. new cached result will be generated)
 * 
 * >>> memory: 
 * - here memory is stored inside // => "CACHE"
 * 
 * - In react, 
 * >>> Memoize components with: "memo function"
 * >>> Memoize objects with:    "useMemo hook"
 * >>> Memoize functions with:  "useCallback hook"
 *      - which will prevent wasted renders and improve application-speed and responsiveness
 * 
 * * MEMO function:
 * - used to create a component that will not re-render when its parent re-renders, as long as the passed props stay the same between renders 
 * (we use "memo" to create a memoized component)
 * 
 * - function inputs are props and calling functions multiple times is equal to re-rendering in react
 *      - therefore, memoizing a component means not to re-render it (if only props stay the same across renders)
 * 
 * SKETCH:
 * >>> regular behavior (no MEMO)
 * components            child
 * re-renders     ->   re-renders
 * 
 * >>> memoized child (with MEMO)
 * 
 *            same props: "memoized child" does not re-render  
 *           /
 * components
 * re-renders
 *           \
 *            new props: "memoized child" re-renders
 * 
 * - memoizing a component do *only effects props* 
 *      - a memoized component will still re-render when its own state changes OR when a context that it is subscribed to changes
 * (in this above 2 situations only, component gets new data to render on UI (even it is memoized or not))
 * 
 * (do we need to memo all the components, ans: NO)
 * - memo is only used when we working with a heavy component (which slowly renders), when a component re-renders often with same props
 * 
 * $ CONCLUSION:
 * - wasted renders are only problem when re-renders happen too frequently
 *      - (OR) when component is slow in rendering 
 * 
 * - when component is light and fast (OR) if that component only re-renders from time-time 
 *      - then memoizing has no benefit at all
 * 
 * ! 5. memo in Practice
 * 
 * - we used "Atomic-Blog" project to demonstrate this memo in practice!
 * 
 * - inside "Atomic-Blog" there is a section of "show and hide archive posts"..
 *      - which will render 10_000 posts 
 * 
 * - while rendering this may take more time to render itself and also other components 
 *      - by causing a "lag" in re-rendering 
 * 
 * >>> reason:
 * - archive-posts component is children of "App" component 
 *      -  archive state lives inside App
 * 
 * - if we update state inside "App" 
 *      - then "App" will trigger re-render in all other components that were below it (as children)
 *          (which also includes: "archive-posts" component)
 * 
 * - to update the state inside "App".. we used "search" component and searched for posts
 * 
 * >>> Memoization:
 * - this archive-post is the best component for memoization- in practice
 * ex:
 * ---
 * // - inside App() component:
// -------------------------------
function App() {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState(() =>
    Array.from({ length: 30 }, () => createRandomPost())
  );
  const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState("");
  const [isFakeDark, setIsFakeDark] = useState(false);

  // Derived state. These are the posts that will actually be displayed
  const searchedPosts =
    searchQuery.length > 0
        ? posts.filter((post) =>
            `${post.title} ${post.body}`
                .toLowerCase()
                .includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase())
            )
        : posts;
    ...
    return (
        <section>
            <button...</button>
            <Header
                posts={searchedPosts}
                onClearPosts={handleClearPosts}
                searchQuery={searchQuery}
                setSearchQuery={setSearchQuery}
            />
            <Main posts={searchedPosts} onAddPost={handleAddPost} />
            <Archive show={false}/> // - prop has been passed here
            <Footer />
        </section>
    );
}
 * 
 * // - inside Archive() function:
// ------------------------------------
 * ex:
--------
function Archive({ show }) {        // - receiving props
  const [posts] = useState(() =>
    // ðŸ’¥ WARNING: This might make computer slow! Try a smaller `length` first (used: 10_000 here!)
    Array.from({ length: 10_000 }, () => createRandomPost())
  );
  const [showArchive, setShowArchive] = useState(show);
  return (
    <aside>
      <h2>Post archive</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setShowArchive((s) => !s)}>
        {showArchive ? "Hide archive posts" : "Show archive posts"}
      </button>
      {showArchive && (
        <ul>
          {posts.map((post, i) => (
            <li key={i}>
              <p>
                <strong>{post.title}:</strong> {post.body}
              </p>
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </aside>
  );
}
 * 
 * >>> after memoization:
 * - we now use "memo" fun to wrap this: "Archive" function
 * ex:
---------
const Archive = memo(
    function Archive({ show }) {
        const [posts] = useState(() =>
            // ðŸ’¥ WARNING: This might make your computer slow! Try a smaller `length` first
            Array.from({ length: 10000 }, () => createRandomPost())
        );
        const [showArchive, setShowArchive] = useState(show);
        return (
            <aside>
            <h2>Post archive</h2>
            <button onClick={() => setShowArchive((s) => !s)}>
                {showArchive ? "Hide archive posts" : "Show archive posts"}
            </button>
            {showArchive && (
                <ul>
                {posts.map((post, i) => (
                    <li key={i}>
                    <p>
                        <strong>{post.title}:</strong> {post.body}
                    </p>
                    </li>
                ))}
                </ul>
            )}
            </aside>
        );
    }
);
 * 
 * - the process we followed to demonstrate that app lags.. 
 *      - as "searching" functionality lies inside App().. we used this "Search" to demonstrate 
 * 
 * >>> the process:
 * #1 start recorder inside "Profiler-Tool"
 * (enable settings: "Record why each component rendered while profiling")
 * 
 * #2 search for posts
 * (before clicking on "Archive-Posts")
 * 
 * #3 click on "Archive"
 * (takes some time to load 10_000 posts)
 * 
 * #4 again search for posts (in search-box)
 * 
 * #5 stop the recorder inside "Profiler-Tool"
 * 
 * - this process has to be done before and after using "memo" to wrap the "Archive-function" 
 *      - this will demonstrate "how and which component makes the whole application: slow"
 * 
 * $ IMPORTANT (imp points to remember)
 * - memoizing a component has nothing to do with updating the state.. 
 *      - this process only effects the props
 * (that's why even after memoizing "archive" fn.. clicking on "Show-Archives" took same amount of time, that took before memoizing the component)
 * 
 * - memoization stops the re-rendering (even though props hasn't changed!)
 * 
 * ? even though component (archive-fn) is memoized there will be problem ?
 * (when we pass an object in the place of a prop-value (though same prop-value is stored in object))
 * ex:
 * ---
const archiveOptions = {
  show: false,
  title: "Archive posts in addition to main posts",
};


function App() {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState(() =>
    Array.from({ length: 30 }, () => createRandomPost())
  );
  const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState("");
  const [isFakeDark, setIsFakeDark] = useState(false);

  // - Derived state. These are the posts that will actually be displayed
  const searchedPosts =
    searchQuery.length > 0
      ? posts.filter((post) =>
          `${post.title} ${post.body}`
            .toLowerCase()
            .includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase())
        )
      : posts;
    ...
    return (
        <section>
        <button> ... </button>
        <Header
            posts={searchedPosts}
            onClearPosts={handleClearPosts}
            searchQuery={searchQuery}
            setSearchQuery={setSearchQuery}
        />
        <Main posts={searchedPosts} onAddPost={handleAddPost} />
        <Archive archiveOptions={archiveOptions} />     //- archiveOptions: object >> passed here!
        <Footer />
        </section>
    );
}
 * 
 * - receiving and consuming props
 * ex:
 * ---
const Archive = memo(function Archive({ archiveOptions }) {
  const [posts] = useState(() =>
    // - ðŸ’¥ WARNING: This might make your computer slow! Try a smaller `length` first
    Array.from({ length: 10000 }, () => createRandomPost())
  );
  const [showArchive, setShowArchive] = useState(archiveOptions.show);
  return (
    <aside>
      <h2>{archiveOptions.title}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setShowArchive((s) => !s)}>
        {showArchive ? "Hide archive posts" : "Show archive posts"}
      </button>
      {showArchive && (
        <ul>
          {posts.map((post, i) => (
            <li key={i}>
              <p>
                <strong>{post.title}:</strong> {post.body}
              </p>
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </aside>
  );
});
 * 
 * >>> repeat the same observation and observe the recorder of "Profiler"
 * - so, even though the "function Archive({ archiveOptions })" is memoized.. 
 *      - this component started to re-render (even though props have not been changed!)
 * 
 * => in next lecture:
 * - why this happened?
 * 
 * ! 6. Understanding useMemo and useCallback
 * (let's talk what we know until now..)
 * 
 * #1
 * - in react, everything is re-created on every render (includes objects and fns)
 * (obj and fns only when they are defined inside a component)
 * - new render gets new fn and objs (even if they are same as before!)
 * 
 * #2
 * $ WKT:
 * - in js, two objects or functions that look the same, are actually different ({} != {})
 * (even they contain same key-pair values, they are unique)
 * 
 * >>> with above info:
 * - we conclude that..
 *      - if objects or functions are passed as "props", the child component will always see them as new props on each re-render
 * $ NOTE:
 * - MEMO "will not work" 
 *      - if props are different between re-renders
 * 
 * ? PROBLEM ?
 * $ IMP CONCLUSION:
 * - even if we memoize a component by providing objects and functions as props 
 *      - then "THE COMPONENT WILL ALWAYS RE-RENDER"
 * (child comp see those as new props, even though they are exactly the same)
 * 
 * >>> SOLUTION:
 * - to make those objects and fns stable, 
 * * we have to preserve them between renders by memoizing them  
 * 
 * (to do that..)
 * - React, provides us.. two more hooks:
 *      => useMemo and useCallback
 * 
 * * useMemo:
 * - used to memoize values between renders
 * 
 * * useCallback:
 * (useCallback: a special case of useMemo)
 * - used to memoize functions bwt renders
 * 
 * >>> BTS:
 * - what ever the value we use into "useMemo" and "useCallback" will be stored inside memory ("CACHED") 
 *      - and that CACHED value will then be returned in future re-renders, as long as dependencies (inputs) stay same
 * 
 * - useMemo and useCallback hook have dependency arrays (similar to useEffect):
 *      - whenever these dependencies changes.. then value will no longer be returned from CACHE (MEMORY) but will be "re-created"
 * (similar to: "memo" fn where a comp gets re-created whenever the props changes)
 * 
 * SKETCH:
 * >>> regular behavior (no useMemo)
 * components            
 * re-renders     ->   new value (created)
 * 
 * >>> memoized value (with useMemo)
 *                                  stmt is true: only when dependencies doesn't change in dep-array 
 *                                                      /
 *            same deps: "CACHED" values are returned >>> "NO" new value is created 
 *           /      (stable across re-renders || values does not change)
 * components
 * re-renders
 *           \
 *            new values is then created (as if memoization has never been happened)
 *                      /
 *              if dependencies changes 
 * 
 * ? when do we need all these ?
 * (three big use-cases) 
 * #1
 * - memoizing props to prevent wasted renders (done together with memo fn)
 * 
 * #2
 * - memoizing values to avoid expensive re-calculations on every render
 * (problem: a derived state - calculated from an array of 100_000 items - if comp re-renders - react need to do this calculation again and again on each re-render)
 * (to- fix: we preserve the value of the calculation across renders using "useMemo")
 * 
 * #3
 * - memoizing values that are used inside dependency array of other hooks
 * (ex: in-order to avoid infinite "useEffect" loops)
 * 
 * $ IMP:
 * - we should not over-use these hooks >>> only used when we face above three use-cases
 *
