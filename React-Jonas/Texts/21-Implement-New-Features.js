// ! New Ideas To Implement !
// --------------------------
/**
 * 
 * #1 create new bookings
 *      - if a guest arrives at hotel then staff could book a cabin for guest that he/she is interested in!
 *      - and check them in!
 * 
 * #2 edit booking
 *      - editing a booking on the request of guests
 *      - even adding check-in and check-out timings
 * 
 * #3 varying prices 
 *      - staff can set different prices for cabins/rooms 
 *      - prices may vary on occasions [festive discounts]
 *      - [increasing price of cabins on specific days when it is in demand]
 * 
 * #4 separate restaurant page
 *      - where staff can register a bill value for guests who had lunch / dinner at hotel
 * 
 * #5 generating invoice PDF
 *      - generating a PDF invoice and main to guests on after their check-outs
